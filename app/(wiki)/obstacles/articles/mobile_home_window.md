**Mobile Home Window**, along with [Mobile Home](/buildings/mobile_home), was added in the v0.15.0 "Pulling the Pins" update.

# Location and Spawning

Each [Mobile Home](/buildings/mobile_home) comes with a Mobile Home Window that is attached to it.

# Loot & More

Being just a decorative object, Mobile Home Window doesn't drop any loot upon destroying it.

Unlike every other window, Mobile Home Window, once broken, you can pass through it

# Tips

- If you are ambushed inside the mobile home, you can destroy the window and escape.
   - Since many people know this trick, you can aim at the window to ambush players inside the [Mobile Home](/buildings/mobile_home), not just the door.
