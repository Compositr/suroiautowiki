The **Grenade Box** is an [Obstacle](/obstacles) added in v0.16.0 "A Sailor's Dream" update on Febuary 25, 2024

# Location & Spawning

Grenade Boxs spawn randomly replacing a [Box](/obstacles/box) within the 5 [Warehouses](/buildings/warehouse) scattered around the map.

# Loot & More

Grenade Boxes spawn only either 1 [Frag Grenade}(/weapons/throwables/frag_grenade) or 1 [Smoke Grenade](/weapons/throwables/smoke_grenade). It's a 50/50 chance to decide which grenade spawns.

# Tips 

- The Grenade Box is not an obstacle you want to hide behind because it doesn't cover your whole body.
  - If you're in need of an extra grenade, break this.
