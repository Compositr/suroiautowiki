The **Tugboat**, not to be confused with the [Captain's Tugboat](/buildings/tugboat_red), is a medium structure added in v0.16.0 "A Sailor's Dream" update on February 25, 2024. In the Tugboat everything is the same to the Captain's Tugboat except for instead of the [Lux Crate](/obstacles/lux_crate) there is a [Gun Case](/obstacles/gun_case) in its place.

# Location & Spawning

Just like the [Captain's Tugboat](/buildings/tugboat_red) the Tugboat spawns on the outskirts of the map in the water surrounding the island. Only 5 Tugboats spawn per game.

# Tips
- If an enemy is in the Tugboat, either shoot the [Tugboat Control Pane](/obstacles/tugboat_control_panel) or throw a few [Frag Grenades](/weapons/throwables/frag_grenade) in there to kill them.
- This is a good first place to loot in as there are a lot of lootable obstacles on the Tugboat.
