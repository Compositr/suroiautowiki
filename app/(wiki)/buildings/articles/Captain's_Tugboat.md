The **Captain's Tugboat** is a medium sized structure added in the v0.16.0 "A Sailor's Dream" update on February 25, 2024. It contains the [Lux Crate](/obstacles/lux_crate) and several other unique obstacles.

# Location & Spawning 

One Captain's Tugboat spawns per game on the outskirts of the map in the water surrounding the island.

# Tips 
- If an opponent is approaching try to break the [Lux Crate](/obstacles/lux_crate) or shoot them down in the water while they are slowed.
- You do not want to stay in there for long because if the opponent shoots and breaks the [Tugboat Control Panel](/obstacles/tugboat_control_panel) and it will explode killing you.
- If an opponent is in the Tugboat either shoot the Tugboat Control Panel or throw [Frag Grenades](/weapons/throwables/frag_grenade) in there to kill them.
