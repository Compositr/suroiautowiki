The **Cargo Ship** is a sub-building of the [Port](/buildings/port). It was added in the [v0.11.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.11.0) "Making Waves" update on October 22, 2024. It features a big cargo area, which contains [Containers](/buildings/containers), and a control room where you can find a [Gas Can](/weapons/melee/gas_can) to activate the [Generator](/obstacles/generator).

# Location & Spawning

The Cargo Ship can be found spawning offshore of the Port on the edge of the map in 50% of games.

# Areas

## Control Room

The control room contains a [Tugboat Control Panel](/obstacles/control_panels) and a [Gas Can](/weapons/melee/gas_can) in the middle of the room.

## Cargo Area

The cargo holds [Containers](/buildings/containers), and a red [Generator](/obstacles/generator) which can be used using the [Gas Can](/weapons/melee/gas_can) to open a vault door, making the only [Tango Crate](/obstacles/tango_crate) accessible to players.

# Tips 

- When you get on the Cargo Ship, make sure to check out if there's been a player on it. Expect players.
- Take advantage of obstacles on the ship to fight other players.
- It's advised to open the vault door and get [Tango-51's](/weapons/guns/tango_51).
