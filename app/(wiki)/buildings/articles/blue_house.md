# Blue House

The Blue House is a variant of the classic [Red House](/buildings/red_house) and is the newest house to be added in the game. 



# Location & Spawning

1 Blue House tries to spawn every map, but usually there are more, scattered throughout the map.


# Loot & More

In part of the Blue House, there is a vault - 3  [Boxes](/obstacles/box), and some ground loot in the front. Because the loot in the vault isn't that good, ideally loot the other parts of the house first. 



 # Tips

-This structure, due to the average loot drop, may often be left untouched - so for players who spawned later, this can be a gold mine. 

-There is a covered entrance in the back of the house that you can ambush players with; as you are hidden from the other players view. The [Flues](/guns/flues) is a good option for this. 

-Explode the [Stove](/obstacles/stove) with a gun to break the [Fridge](/obstacles/fridge) and [Small Drawer](/obstacles/small_drawer)

-Use the skylights to check if there are players inside - but be careful, because often they may be able to see you as well. 



 # Trivia

 -This is the newest house added to the game in the v.19 update.
