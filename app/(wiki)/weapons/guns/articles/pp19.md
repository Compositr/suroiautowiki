# Strategies

## Using
- The PP-19 consumes lots of ammo, so make sure to stock up on as much 9mm ammunition as you can. 
- Using this weapon is very similar to using the [Vector](/weapons/guns/vector), so use it as you would use a vector. 
- The big difference is that the PP-19 has much more range for the bullets so it can be used as a medium-ranged weapons. 
- One of the most effective ways to use this, is to get close to your opponent to make sure they get hit with as much bullets as possible.

## Countering 
- Hide behind indestructible [Obstacles](/obstacles), unless you have good armor and high damage weapons.
- When the opponent is reloading, take opportunity and get a few shots at them, this will lower their health and make them unable to defend themselves.
- An effective measure is to have your opponent waste their ammo so that they have to use other weapons. 
- Getting into the open when your opponent has a PP-19 might get you killed, but if it happens try and strafe as many bullets as you can.

# Obtaining
The PP-19 is only found in [Gold Airdrops](/obstacles/airdrops) and [Flint Stones](/obstacles/flint_stone).
