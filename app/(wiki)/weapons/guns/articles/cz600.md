The **CZ-600 Rifle**, known in-game as the **CZ-600**, is a bolt-action sniper utilizing the 5.56mm ammunition. It was added to the game in the v0.16.0 "A Sailor's Dream" update on February 25, 2024. It has a slow fire rate, but packs incredible damage.

# Background
The CZ-600 is a versatile target and and hunting rifle for highly precise shooting at a medium to long distances. The CZ-600 was produced by CZ, a renown firearms manufacturer based in the Czech Republic.

# Strategies

## Using
- Take advantage of the high accuracy, speed, and damage to snipe enemies from a safer distance.
  - If you are skilled enough, it can be used at close-range, though this can be dangerous if your opponent possesses a weapon designed for close-range combat such as the [Model 37](/weapons/guns/model_37).
- Keep your distance by running away while shooting, as well as quickswitching if your opponent rushes you.

## Countering 
- Don't rush your opponent directly. If you're planning on rushing someone with a CZ-600, move around obstacles so that it's less likely for them to hit you.
- If you have a sniper of your own, like a [Mosin-Nagant](/weapons/guns/mosin) you can do a duel with snipers with your opponent until you kill them.

# Obtaining
The CZ-600 is obtainable rarely in [Crates](/obstacles/crates), [Airdrops](/obstacles/airdrops), [Viking Chests](/obstacles/viking_chest), and [River Chests](/obstacles/river_chest), but it always spawns in  the [Lux Crate](/obstacles/lux_crate) located in the [Red Tugboat](/buildings/tugboat_red).
