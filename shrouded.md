**Shrouded** is a [Perk](/perks) added in the [v0.2.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.21.0) "Plumpkin Panic" update on October 31st, 2024. It emits a trail of smoke behind the player equipped with it. 

# Effects
The player equipped with Shrouded constantly emits a thick trail of smoke

# Obtaining
In Halloween Mode, Shrouded drops from the [Diseased Plumpkins](/obstacles/diseased_plumpkin) which are scattered through the map and one is located in the [Plumpkin Bunker](/buildings/plumpkin_bunker_meta). Shrouded did **not**  drop from either [Airdrops](/obstacles/airdrops) or [Gold Airdrops](/obstacles/gold_airdrop_crate).

# Strategies
## Using
- This perk is 
- Shotguns and any other CQC weapon naturally synergies well with the Close Quarters Combat perk.
  - The increased reload speed makes single reloads even faster with shotguns.
- Avoid using snipers and DMRs with Close Quarters combat, as they won't benefit at all unless you are close enough.
- You can also use the damage modifier to boost the damage of [Melee Weapons](/weapons/melee), although the 10% is a modest boost.
- Try and stick to [Buildings](/buildings), as that is where this [Perk](/perks) shines the most.
  - Close Quarters Combat is even stronger in the enclosed space of bunkers.

## Countering
- Stay far away from your opponent, so that Close Quarters Combat can't activate, and use longer range weapons (DMRs/snipers).
- Even if you do end up close to your opponent, remember that the damage boost is only 10%, and if you hit your shots you should still come out on top.
- Use a Perk that increases speed, such as [Berserker](/perks/stark_melee_gauntlet) or [Second Wind](/perks/second_wind), as this will make you harder to hit in close range as well as giving you the freedom to quickly leave the range at which Close Quarters Combat is active.
