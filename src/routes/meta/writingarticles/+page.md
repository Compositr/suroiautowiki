# Writing Articles

First of all, thanks for helping out with the documentation! Since this wiki is community-run, we need all the help we can get.
Since this wiki is a custom coded solution, creating articles is a bit different to what you might be used to over on Fandom.

Articles are written in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/docs/what-is-mdx/), an extension of the typical Markdown you may be used to.

# Style Guide

When writing an article for an object in the game, please follow the layout below. If in doubt, consult an existing
article (e.g., [AK47](/weapons/guns/ak47)).

## Article Layout

## General Pointers

- Articles should be written in American English (e.g. color rather than colo**u**r)

# Syntax

See the [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/docs/what-is-mdx/) docs for a detailed overview of MDX. If you are new to Markdown, you can find a
guide [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

Also, make sure to adhere to the following grammar rules:

1. Use American English (e.g. color rather than colo**u**r) for all articles on the wiki.
